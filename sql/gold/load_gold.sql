Load Gold Layer (Silver -> Gold)
===============================================================================
Script Purpose:
    This script creates the gold layer views from the silver layer tables.
    Since gold layer uses views, there's no need for a separate load procedure.
    The views are automatically updated when the silver layer data changes.
    
Note: In this case, the gold layer is already created by ddl_gold.sql as views.
This file exists to maintain consistency with the DAG structure.
===============================================================================
*/

-- Gold layer views are created via ddl_gold.sql
-- Views automatically reflect the latest data from silver layer
-- No additional loading is needed for views

SELECT 'Gold layer views created successfully' AS status;
